# Ranxware V3.1
*A re-revival of Ranxware.*

> [!note]
> Ranxware V3.1 is completely free to use and is not intended to become somewhat of a "business".
> 
> Ranxware V3.1 is also a ***temporary*** script hub which means that there is little effort put into the scripts. The script hub can also become discontinued at any moment, if I don't feel like updating anymore. Some scripts can be either patched, outdated or broken. The scripts inside Ranxware will occasionally be updated one in a while.

> [!important]
> This script is intended for **PC users only**. I will not hesitate to fix any errors from mobile devices or other executors, hence why it is a `temporary` script hub.
